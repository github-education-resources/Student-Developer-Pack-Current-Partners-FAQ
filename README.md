Learn to ship software like a pro. There's no substitute for hands-on experience. But for most students, real world tools can be cost-prohibitive. That's why we created the GitHub Student Developer Pack with some of our partners and friends.

This repo gives you an overview of the Student Developer Pack, the current partners in the pack and answers to frequently asked questions about the pack.


**What is the Student Developer Pack?**
- The Student Developer Pack is a collection of student-only benefits from some of the world's most innovative companies. Student Developer Pack partners work with GitHub to extend these offers to our verified students because they know that the best way to support future developers is by gaining hands-on experience with industry standard products and tools.

**How do I get access to the Student Developer Pack?**
- The GitHub Student Developer Pack is only available to students aged 13 or older. Before you receive access to the offers we need to verify that you are a student. Teachers, researchers, faculty, staff, and other educational users can get free and discounted access to GitHub, but are not eligible for the Pack. Once you are confirmed as a verified student, you will be able to access the Student Developer Pack here.

**What companies have student offers in the Student Developer Pack?**
- See the below listing of the current Student Developer Pack Partners [last updated 1/29/24, added Codedex offer].

**I thought [X Company] was in the pack. Where did it go?**
- Note that Student Developer Pack offers are not permanent and do sometimes change in scope or are removed from the pack all together. If you redeem a partner offer, then that partner leaves the pack, in most cases, you can complete the term of the offer.

**I am a verified student but I can’t access a certain pack offer.**
- First confirm that your student status is still valid (note that student validation lasts for 2 years, after which you will need to revalidate your student status). If you’ve confirmed that your student status is valid but you are unable to access a current, live Student Developer Pack offer, please contact that partner via their support email or ticketing system. If that still does not work, please visit Discussions or view our support page and someone from GitHub Education can look into your issue. There is also this [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/111352) post that has the most up to date information about applying for benefits, common wait times, and the most likely reasons for rejection.
